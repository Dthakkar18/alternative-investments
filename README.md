# 📦 Collectible Investment Platform – Seller Listing Model

A platform where collectors can list high-value items (sneakers, Pokémon cards, watches, etc.) for **fractional investment**.  
Users crowdfund ownership, the platform securely stores/authenticates the item, and resale profits are shared proportionally.

## 💡 Problem & Opportunity
**Problem:**
- Rare collectibles are **illiquid** and inaccessible to small investors.
- High prices lock out many buyers.
- Trust/authentication issues slow peer-to-peer investment.

**Opportunity:**
- Democratize access to collectibles as an asset class.
- Provide liquidity for collectors.
- Build a trusted, culture-focused marketplace.
